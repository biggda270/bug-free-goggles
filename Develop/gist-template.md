## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors match positions before, after, or between characters. The $ in our expression is an example of this

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers deternmine how many instances of an object have to be present to make a match. These can be lazy or greedy
### OR Operator
Or operator is used by the | character. It is a logical operator
### Character Classes
This determines what charcaters are included in the match. This is used in our example


### Bracket Expressions
Square brackets create a character set. This set matches characters that are identified. 

### Greedy and Lazy Match
Greedy matches tries to repeat the token as many times as possible, and gives up matches as the engine tries to find an overall match.

Lazy matches first repeats the token as few times as required, and expands the match as the engine goes through the regex to find an overall match.


### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look ahead and look behind matches characters and gives up the mnatch. They only assert wether a match is possible or not
